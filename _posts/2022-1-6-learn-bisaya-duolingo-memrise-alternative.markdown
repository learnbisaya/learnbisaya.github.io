At the time of this writing. Cebuano/Bisaya is not yet available on Duolingo. However, Memrise offers a great course on learning the Cebuano language.

[See course](<https://app.memrise.com/courses/english-us/cebuano/>)

The only thing lacking is audio reference. Keep in mind that Cebuano/Bisaya is a tonal language. One change in how you pronounce a word can mean differently.

For example:

Weak/Flimsy: *l√∫.ya*

Ginger: luy-a

When translating a single word I would recommend [binisaya.com](<https://www.binisaya.com/cebuano>)<br>

If you are translating a Bisaya/Cebuano sentence to English I would recommend Google Translate.
